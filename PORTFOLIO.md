This assignment was chosen because it uses 5 different algorithms to solve the given problem. Other assignments only involved implementing only few algorithms. The objective was to design search algorithms that find a path from a given start point to the goal state. It consisted of mazes that were drawn using basic symbols and letters that had a starting point and an end point. To solve this maze algorithms were created, such as DFS, BFS, UCS, Best Fit Search and A*. These mentioned algorithms were already invented before by different people, the objective was to come up with a solution using the main idea of these algorithms. Therefore, it demonstrates the ability utilize the necessary appropriate data structures to complete the assignment independently. This also shows evidence of critical thinking. Additionally, the solution wouldnâ€™t have worked without testing, debugging and examining the given problem.
